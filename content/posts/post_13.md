As mentioned in our previous post, we have new website, which is responsive and mobile friendly.
LOADays has a renewed our online presence, we will continue to use our Twitter account [@loadays](https://twitter.com/loadays)
and are now also on Facebook and LinkedIN.  

In addition to that, we now also have a new MatterMost instance, linked to our IRC channel and our Slack instance.
The MatterMost channel #general is linked to #loadays on FreeNode and with Slack, so all messages are shared between them.

We hope to have more active social participation on different social media.
