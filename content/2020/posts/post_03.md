For the upcoming Loadays we are again looking for sponsors to make this event happen.
We rely on sponsoring to help cover costs to accommodate speakers, infrastructure, provide food
at affordable prices, etc..

This way we can keep the event free

### Levels of sponsorship

- **Bronze** (250€) : small logo on the website
- **Silver** (500€) : logo on the website and mentioned on mailings to visitors and speakers
- **Gold** (750€ +) : Full visibility (logo on website, printed materials) and the ability to speak about your company for 5 minutes at the start of the conference

In case you are interested in one of the options above, please drop us an email
at <info@loadays.org>.
